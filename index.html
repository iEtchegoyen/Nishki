She is shown to have brownish-red hair on the first chapter cover but is shown to have more of a blue-purplish hair color on the volume cover.

Her idol outfit is adorned in a pink aesthetic of varying degrees of lighter and darker shades. The outfit's design is an overall ruffled appearance. A black belt is located on her waist, and other miscellaneous accessories are present throughout the design: three blue stars on her chest, a heart-shaped necklace on her neck, and a bunny hairpin accentuated by two gold stars and a pink ribbon.</div>
<div class="__anmcircle"></div><div class="__anmnum">Personality</div><br><div class="__amtext"> Before becoming an idol, Ai Hoshino was a misanthropist. When she was very young, her mother was arrested on a theft charge, and even after her release, she did not care enough to raise Ai anymore. The environment she suffered being with her abusive mother caused her to think of ways to protect herself. Ai lacked any memory of loving or ever being loved herself -- prominently shown when Ichigo Saitou scouted for idols to start a group. She believed she lacked the qualification to become due to these reasons, showcasing a lack of faith in herself. She became quickly convinced to join when Saitou told her that lying is fine and is, in fact, a desirable trait.

Thus, Ai's perspectives started to shift. She convinced herself that lies are a form of love -- a love harbored out of the selfish desires of both sides of the spectrum. Ai sought to find an object for her "love." She wanted to learn how to love by telling her fans that her deceitful lies are, in fact, love. This desire also came when she bore children, but in a different context. She never once said that she loved them because being disingenuous towards them would be terrifying.

No matter what, lies allowed her to process the world around her. Within these contexts, she never sought to make things right to the point where she was fine to face the consequences of her actions. Lies were her way of expressing love -- hoping that one day, they would become the truth. Only when a terrible event happened did Ai finally realize -- She loved her children, a genuine form of love, free from impurity and dishonesty. She was relieved and satisfied from finally being able to experience these true feelings.</div>
